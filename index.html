    <section id="Achievements">
        <h1>ACHIEVEMENTS</h1>
        <p>At Harrison School we recognise student achievement and effort through a system of awards.
            The award system supports classroom reinforcement and Management strategies. Harrison Awards
            can be given by any member of staff across a number of learning environments and are cumulative.
            When a student has collected 10 Harrison Awards they receive a Principal’s Award and a school pen
            or pencil.
            School certificates are handed out at the Preschool – Yr. 4 and Yr. 5 - 10 assemblies. School certificates
            count as two (2) Harrison Awards.
            When a student has earned five (5) Principal’s Awards they receive a school drink bottle and a voucher
            for the canteen.
            For ten (10) Principal’s Awards, a student will receive a voucher for the canteen and a uniform free day
            for their home group.
            When a student reaches 15 Principal’s Awards, they receive a gold certificate, medallion and their
            name is recorded on the school honour board. A special event will be organised for their home group.
